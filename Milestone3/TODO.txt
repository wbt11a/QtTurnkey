To Do Coding Wise for Milestone3

-add logic to test if the other 3 ip textbars have input and if so to launch individual threads
-figure out how to display install progress
-add configuration tab next to file

-add logic to read from file and execute on n hosts (max simultaneous specified in configuration tab)
-Make class parser its own class.
-possibly add more try/catch blocks to prevent program crashing in various places (load file, ssh connect, download, install, etc)

-Figure out some sort of formalized testing to satisfy teacher
